This repo contains all of the code for my analysis of the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) data.  It was
written in the summers of 2014 and 2015 at the University of
Utah.  There is a lot of chaff and test scripts in here;
for the most part, the only thing that matters is ad_phat_tools.py.
